Translation of Paul O'Gorman's matlab code (http://www.mit.edu/~pog/src/precip_extremes_scaling.m), following O'Gorman and Schneider, PNAS, 106, 14773-14777, 2009. Takes vertical profile of vertical velocity; vertical profile of temperature; vertical profile of pressure levels; and surface pressure, and outputs rainfall in kg/m^2/s.
